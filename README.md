# Steganography
 A system to hide document in a cover object an (image) . 
 Image has a huge number of pixels present that are used to store bytes of the document.
 In this system the least significal bits of the bands of the pixel are overwritten to store the (splitted) bytes.
 A header containing the type and size of the document allows precise retrieval of the bytes and reformation of the embedded document.
